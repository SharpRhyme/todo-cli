# Python CLI to-do app

**Description**

This is a basic python application used for managing a simple to do list. It takes use of a csv file allowing items to be stored even after the program being terminated. This also allows for extra formatting to be added e.g through Microsoft Excel due to the spreadsheet format.

**Usage**

using python, run the file. You will be greeted with a friendly command line asking to input a command:

1. a - add todo
2. d - delete todo
3. v - view todo
4. c - mark todo as checked
5. q - quit

These commands allow you to manipulate the spreadsheet easily, right from the terminal
